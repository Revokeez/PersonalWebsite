          During my tenure as a Research Intern at Master Workforce in the summer of 2022, 
          I delved into the intricate world of modeling and simulation, 
          specifically focusing on Phishing Identification and Decision Support Systems.
          This opportunity allowed me to grasp the fundamental concepts underlying these systems while honing my skills in their practical application.
          <br><br>One of the highlights of my internship was my integral role in the development of a cutting-edge web application geared towards training employees in phishing attack prevention,
          thereby bolstering overall cybersecurity measures. Leveraging my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
          I spearheaded the front-end development of this platform, crafting an interactive and informative user interface that facilitated effective learning and engagement for users.
          Through this experience, I not only expanded my technical capabilities but also gained invaluable insight into the critical importance of cybersecurity in today's digital landscape.

            As a member of my university's team, I had the privilege of harnessing cutting-edge technology to advance the capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for diverse mission objectives.
           One of the pivotal aspects of my role involved utilizing Dronekit, a sophisticated platform, to develop autonomous flight routines.
           This allowed us to enhance the drones' capabilities, enabling them to execute complex tasks with precision and efficiency.
           Additionally, I played a key role in leveraging MAVproxy, a powerful tool, to manage communication between ground control stations and 
           drones.<br><br> By ensuring seamless data exchange and control, we optimized coordination and operational efficiency during missions.
           Implementing MAVlink protocols was another crucial aspect of our work, as it enabled us to establish reliable communication links and
           facilitate real-time telemetry monitoring. These efforts were essential for ensuring mission success and safety, underscoring the
           importance of robust communication systems in UAV operations. Overall, being part of this team provided me with invaluable hands-on 
           experience in UAV technology and reinforced the significance of collaboration and innovation in advancing aerospace capabilities.
